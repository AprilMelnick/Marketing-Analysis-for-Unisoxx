# Marketing Analysis for Unisoxx


## Overview
Created as my final project for the WBS Marketing Analytics Course, this was an intense three week project where I completed an assessment of Q1 and Q2 2021 for an ecommerce sock shop called Unisoxx. During this process, I proved to myself that I have the ability understand the ecommerce ecosystem as a full stack marketer and deliver actionable results.

## Concept

Unisoxx was started on a simple concept: selling high quality socks that aren't gendered. 
The business went online with the first sales in 2021. The company is doing well, but there is one person on the marketing team who handles all marketing needs.

I was hired as a Marketing Analyst to: 
- help organize and maintain the MarTech stack
- analyze marketing data 
- assist in assessing the state of the business in preparation for future funding

## Tasks completed
- built and designed the website using HTML and CSS
- created a tracking measurement plan for implementation in Google Tag Manager
- created a tool provider decision matrix to update the MarTech stack for Unisoxx
- implementation of all tags in GTM
- development of questions regarding status quo of Unisoxx, followed by analyzation using Google Biq Query
- two dashboards and visualization of data analysis with Google Looker Studio
- recommendations on how to act on and track future data 
- presentation of data


Happily, my project was chosen for Demo Day where I presented along with all the other graduating classes.
