# Marketing-Analysis-for-Unisoxx
Created as my final project for the WBS Marketing Analytics Course, this was an intense three week project where I completed an assessment of Q1 and Q2 2021 for an ecommerce sock shop called Unisoxx. During this process, I proved to myself that I have the ability understand the ecommerce ecosystem as a full stack marketer.

The tasks completed:
- built the website using HTML and CSS
- created a tracking measurement plan for implementation in Google Tag Manager
- created a tool provider decision matrix to update the MarTech stack for Unisoxx
- implementation of all tags in GTM
- development of questions regarding status quo of Unisoxx, followed by analyzation using Google Biq Query
- visualization of data with Google Looker Studio
- presentation of data


Happily, my project was chosen for Demo Day where I presented along with all the other graduating classes.
